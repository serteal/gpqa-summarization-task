Welcome to **Inspect Evals**, a repository of community contributed LLM evaluations for [Inspect AI](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/). Inspect Evals was created in collaboration by the [UK AI Safety Institute](https://aisi.gov.uk/), [Arcadia Impact](https://www.arcadiaimpact.org/), and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

Community contributions are welcome and encouraged! Please see the [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on submitting new evaluations.

# Getting Started

First, install the `inspect_ai` and `inspect_evals` Python packages with:

```bash
pip install inspect_ai
pip install git+https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals
```

If developing locally, you can install the packages in editable mode with:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

You will also need to install any packages required to interact with the models you'd like to evaluate and define any required API key environment variables. For example, to work with OpenAI models:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai-api-key>
pip install openai
```

Furthermore, some of the evaluations require additional dependencies. If your eval needs extra dependency, instructions for installing them are provided the [list of evals](#list-of-evals) subsection (or the README for that evaluation). For example, to install the dependencies of `SWE-Bench` evaluation you should run:

```bash
   pip install "inspect_evals[swe_bench] @ git+https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_evals"
   pip install -e ".[swe_bench]" # If developing on the package locally
```

Once you have a model configured, you can run evaluations for it with:

```bash
inspect eval inspect_evals/gpqa_diamond --model openai/gpt-4o
```

If you don't want to specify the `--model` each time you run an evaluation, create a `.env` configuration file in your working directory that defines the `INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL` environment variable along with your API key. For example:

```bash
INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai-api-key>
```

Inspect supports many model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Azure AI, AWS Bedrock, Together AI, Groq, Hugging Face, vLLM, Ollama, and more. See the [Model Providers](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/models.html) documentation for additional details.

GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 outperform other models, with holistic generation being the best strategy for them, while incremental generation works better for other models. The study also shows that the performance of LLMs is highly correlated with the number of tokens in the prompt.
